# Venuetrack Frontend

This is the frontend of an app currently in development that aims to be a mashup of Foursquare with custom ratings system, primarily for the city of Thessaloniki, Greece.

Things to be done:

-Create visual template for the venue details bar.

-Adjust css for smaller resolutions.

-Change map to be more clear - add functionality when clicking a venue on the map.

-When clicking a venue on the sidebar, zoom in on its location.

-For each venue, various data are missing (address, url etc). Remove what is not there.

-Add css to venues for when they are hovered and active.

-Change Foursquare icons with glyphicons.
